I'm a research scientist in the [Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE)](https://ccse.lbl.gov/index.html) within the [Computational Research Division](crd.lbl.gov) of the [Computing Sciences Area](https://cs.lbl.gov/) at the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](lbl.gov). I primarily work on the [SEAHORÃ‡E](https://seahorce-scidac.github.io/) project developing the [REMORA](https://remora-ocean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) code. I also work on high-performance particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection, with an eye towards modeling pulsar magnetospheres.

I received my PhD in Physics in 2021 from the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), where I worked in both the [Physics](https://physics.berkeley.edu) and [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Departments. I was one of the primary developers of Sedona, a Monte Carlo radiation transport code. My primary research advisers were [Eliot Quataert](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/) and [Dan Kasen](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/dan-kasen/).

Previously, I was a Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a UC Berkeley Physics Theory Fellow. I spent summer 2017 at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/) working with [Bronson Messer](http://astro.phys.utk.edu/bronson/) on non-blocking communication in [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/). I received my BS in Physics with a minor in Computer Science from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).
