I'm a computational astrophysicst at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu), where I'm a PhD candidate in [Physics](https://physics.berkeley.edu) and work in the [Astronomy](https://astro.berkeley.edu) Department. I use simulations to understand a range astronomical phenomena. I'm one of the primary developers of Sedona, a Monte Carlo radiation transport code. My primary research advisers are [Eliot Quataert](https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~quataert/) and [Dan Kasen](https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/dan-kasen/).

Previously, I was a Department of Energy [Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a UC Berkeley Physics Theory Fellow. I spent summer 2017 at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov/) working with [Bronson Messer](http://astro.phys.utk.edu/bronson/) on non-blocking communication in [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/site/flashcode/). I received my BS in Physics with a minor in Computer Science from [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).
